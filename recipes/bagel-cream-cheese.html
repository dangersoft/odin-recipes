        <h2>The breakfast item of champions. Pair with scrambled eggs to be unstoppable.</h2>
        <p>Hardier than a donut. Softer than a rock. It's the bagel. Who doesn't like a bagel?</p>
        <p>Bagels are a versatile bread item. Breakfast sandwich, pizza alternative, vessel for spread, it can do it all.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Get yourself a bagel. Could be an onion, everything, or multi-grain. 
                I like plain because I'm boring and scared of change.</li>
            <li>Get yourself a cream cheese. Could be chives, strawberry, or roasted red pepper. 
                I like plain because I'm boring and I don't like change.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Cut the bagel in half. You should end up with two "O" shaped pieces.
                If you ended up with two "C"-shaped pieces, immediately consume them and start again.
            </li>
            <li>Toast the two halves to your liking.</li>
            <li>Spread your chosen cream cheese across the surface area of the halves that were exposed by the original cut (ie not the outer crust).</li>
            <li>Serve on a plate! Repeat until you've eaten 12.</li>
        </ol>
